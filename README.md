== Welcome to Code Camp Server

Code Camp Server is a site that we're using for Chicago Code Camp.

Much like the Chicago Code Camp that CCS was created to support,
CCS is a free, open-source application licensed under the GPL. So,
if you'd like to help make CCS better or find a problem, then please
help make it even better by contributing patches or even just submitting
defects in our Github issue tracker.

CCS is written in Rails 3 on Ruby 1.8.7 (ruby-1.8.7-p334). It's intended to be easily 
deployed to Heroku for little or no cost.
